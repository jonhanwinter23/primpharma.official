                                  <p>Our project focuses on developing an advanced AI-driven system for speech recognition that automatically generates reports based on user input. Initially targeting Khmer language speech recognition, we startws with English to streamline the development process. The primary goal is to create a system that can convert spoken language into text, analyze it, and format it into structured reports for various applications, including medical records and architectural documentation.</p>
                                  <p>The system first captured user speech as acoustic signals, digitize these signals, and analyze the frequency spectrum to interpret the spoken words. Leveraging existing speech recognition libraries, such as the SpeechRecognition Python library and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, the system will utilize advanced NLP techniques to summarize and extract key information from the text.</p>
                                  <p>In the realm of speech recognition, advancements are being made across different languages and dialects. Research into speech recognition for various languages, including English and Khmer, reveals that while significant progress has been made, challenges remain, particularly in developing accurate systems for less commonly supported languages. Our approach will build on existing technologies and methodologies to create a robust solution for Khmer language speech recognition.</p>
                                  <p>Our approach involves utilizing AI and machine learning techniques to develop a speech recognition system that can accurately transcribe and analyze spoken language. The system employ established speech recognition libraries and NLP algorithms to process and summarize text, ultimately auto-filling reports based on the analyzed content.</p>
                                  <p>The data collection phase involves capturing audio recordings in English and Khmer. These recordings are then processed to extract acoustic features and converted into text. We used existing speech recognition libraries to handle this process efficiently.</p>
                                  <p>Our system integrated several tools and libraries, including SpeechRecognition for converting speech to text, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for high accuracy, and PyTorch for deep learning tasks. The text analysis will utilize NLP techniques for summarization and keyword extraction, ensuring that the final reports are concise and relevant.</p>
                                  <p>The training process involve using labeled datasets to improve the accuracy of speech recognition models. We will evaluate different libraries and tools, such as SpeechRecognition, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, and PyTorch, to determine the most effective approach for our goals.</p>
                                  <p>We anticipate that the integration of these technologies will yield a system capable of accurately recognizing and transcribing speech in both English and Khmer. Preliminary results are assessed based on accuracy and efficiency in generating reports.</p>
                                  <p>In conclusion, our project aims to develop a sophisticated AI-driven system for speech recognition and report generation. By leveraging advanced libraries and tools, we aim to create a solution that can be adapted for various languages and applications. Future work will focus on refining the system, expanding language support, and exploring additional applications for the technology.</p>
